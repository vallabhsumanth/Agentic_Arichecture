# Agentic_Arichecture
Agentic Architecture is a modular and adaptive software design paradigm that enables the development of autonomous, goal-driven software agents. These agents exhibit decision-making capabilities, context awareness, reasoning, planning, and memory—much like human agents—but in a digital context. The architecture promotes agent-based systems where agents interact with users, environments, tools, and data autonomously or semi-autonomously.

# Core Components of Agentic Architecture
1. Agents
Autonomous entities with defined goals.
Operate based on perception (inputs), reasoning (logic), and actions (outputs).
Agents can remember, learn, and adapt based on experience.

2. Tools
External functionalities that agents can call during reasoning or task execution.
Examples: web browsers, APIs, vector stores, Python interpreters, DBMS.
Tools are modular and can be dynamically loaded or unloaded by agents.

3. Sessions
Encapsulate a conversation or task execution lifecycle.
Preserve memory, context, and interaction history for consistent behavior.
Useful for long-term reasoning and task continuity.

4. Artifacts
Persistent or ephemeral objects that are generated, modified, or consumed by agents.
Examples: files, logs, documents, plans, workflows.
Help maintain reproducibility and transparency.

What is the Agent Development Kit (ADK)?
The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a set of tools, APIs, and libraries used to build, deploy, and manage agents within the Agentic Architecture. It supports the rapid development and orchestration of AI agents with structured memory, tool-use capabilities, and multi-step reasoning.

# Core Features of ADK:
Modular agent creation
Tool integration
Session and memory management
Step-by-step execution and observability
Artifact tracking
Support for nested agents and collaborative reasoning

# Conclusion
Agentic Architecture is reshaping how intelligent systems are built. With the power of agents, tools, sessions, and artifacts, developers can create scalable, interpretable, and highly capable autonomous systems. The ADK streamlines this process by providing a flexible and extensible toolkit to bring ideas into reality.
